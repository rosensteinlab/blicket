This project presents a practical, reprogrammable Blicket Detector designed to support cognitive psychology experiments that investigate causal reasoning in young children. The device combines an Arduino-based microcontroller, an RF remote module, LED strips, switches, and a translucent window to deliver flexible, interactive feedback through light and sound. The design allows different behaviors—such as multi-color illumination and buzzer activation—to be easily reconfigured using existing Arduino libraries, making it simple to adapt to various experimental needs. Powered by a portable power bank, the system features a modular PCB layout that simplifies assembly and maintenance while keeping power consumption low. By providing an intuitive, hands-on way for children to explore cause-and-effect relationships, this Blicket Detector offers researchers a reliable, customizable platform for replicating and extending classic experiments on early cognitive development.
